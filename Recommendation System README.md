# Recommendation System

## Introduction
This project is a basic **Recommendation System** that provides personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences. It leverages collaborative filtering, a popular recommendation technique that uses the ratings of similar users to recommend items.Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals of recommendation systems or an experienced developer interested in building on top of this simple model, this project serves as a great starting point.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**:
 Recommends movies to users based on the ratings of similar users.

- **User-Item Matrix**:
   Converts user ratings into a matrix for efficient computation.
  
- **Cosine Similarity**:
   Measures the similarity between users based on their movie ratings.
  
- **Customizable Recommendations**:
   Adjust the number of recommendations as needed.

## Technologies
The project is built using the following technologies:
- **Python 3.x**:
   The core programming language.
  
- **Pandas**:
   For data manipulation and analysis.
  
- **NumPy**:
   For numerical computations.
  
- **Scikit-learn**:
   For machine learning utilities, specifically for calculating cosine similarity.
  
- **SciPy**:
   For sparse matrix representation.
